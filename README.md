# Packers Gameday Thread Analyzer

I'm building a tool to scrape the comments off a Reddit gameday thread, in which fans discuss an ongoing sports game. It will be particularly focused towards analyzing threads in the Green Bay Packers (American football team) subreddit.

## To-do list
- build tool to scrape comments
- tokenize comments
- group and analyze comments
